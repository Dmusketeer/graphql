# Bookstore Application

## Overview

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing a collection of books. It is built using Node.js and GraphQL, allowing for flexible and efficient data queries and mutations.

## Features

- **Create Books**: Add new books to the collection.
- **Read Books**: Fetch the list of books or a specific book by ID.
- **Update Books**: Modify details of existing books.
- **Delete Books**: Remove books from the collection.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store book data (optional, depending on your implementation).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- MongoDB (if using MongoDB for data storage)

   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   MONGODB_URI= use atlas
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your GraphQL client (e.g., [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)) and navigate to:
